    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      As part of the Composites subsystem, we are pushing to convert to the era of carbon fiber. Are we riding a wave? A fad? A glorifieded material? Maybe.
      But this introduces so many material concepts that it's great to experiment with. I was put in charge of producing a replacement to our aluminum pushrods
      currently on the car's suspension. Just a little something to catch you up, the suspension system on racing vehicles transmit forces from the tire to the
      shocks through these rods. These race cars will either use push/pull rods (same concept just a different configuration).

    <h2>Design Considerations</h2>
    <p> 
      Now many things have to be considered to replace a conventioanal metal part with carbon fiber.
      <ol>
      <li> You can't just thread a rod and stick a bolt in it.</li>
      <li> Compressive Strength</li>
      <li> Tensile Strength</li>
      <li> Insert Design</li>
      <li> Adhesion and Cohesion</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Research Proces</h2>
    <p>
      The main advantage of carbon fiber is that it has amazing tensile strength compared to its weight. Weight reduction is achieved by layering multiple
      plys of carbon fiber cloths and using a special epoxy-resin to fill the air pockets. This gives it an amazing strength-to-weight ratio. On the downside,
      it is pretty weak in out-of-plane shear (a perpendicular force) and compression. So we've basically lost 2 degrees of freedom.<br>
      To compensate for this, we need special ways to interface metal to composites to maximize tension and in-plane forces.

      When running test, we expect something to fail, and I wanted things to fail in this order: (First) Cohesive failure, adhesive failure, pushrod, insert
      (Last)<br> <!-- talk about this later -->
