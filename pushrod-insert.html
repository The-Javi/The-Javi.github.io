    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      As part of the Composites subsystem, we are pushing to convert to the era of carbon fiber. Are we riding a wave? A fad? A glorifieded material? Maybe.
      But this introduces so many material concepts that it's great to experiment with. I was put in charge of producing a replacement to our aluminum pushrods
      currently on the car's suspension. Just a little something to catch you up, the suspension system on racing vehicles transmit forces from the tire to the
      shocks through these rods. These race cars will either use push/pull rods (same concept just a different configuration).

    <h2>Design Considerations</h2>
    <p> 
      Now many things have to be considered to replace a conventioanal metal part with carbon fiber.
      <ol>
      <li> You can't just thread a rod and stick a bolt in it.</li>
      <li> Compressive Strength</li>
      <li> Tensile Strength</li>
      <li> Insert Design</li>
      <li> Adhesion and Cohesion</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Research Proces</h2>
    <p>
      The main advantage of carbon fiber is that it has amazing tensile strength compared to its weight. Weight reduction is achieved by layering multiple
      plys of carbon fiber cloths and using a special epoxy-resin to fill the air pockets. This gives it an amazing strength-to-weight ratio. On the downside,
      it is pretty weak in out-of-plane shear (a perpendicular force) and compression. So we've basically lost 2 degrees of freedom.<br>
      To compensate for this, we need special ways to interface metal to composites, and to maximize tension and in-plane forces.<br>
      Also, when running test, we expect something to fail, and I wanted things to fail in a specific order: <br>
      (First) Cohesion, adhesion, pushrod, insert (Last)<br> <!-- talk about this later -->
    </p>

    <h3> How to interface metal and carbon fiber</h3>
    <p> 
      Without becoming a technical paper, I want to keep it breef. Some things are "stickier" than others like teflon compared to paper. Adhesives such as
      tape and glue don't stick to teflon but are great on paper. Carbon fiber and aluminum are pretty close to teflon so special processes were taken to
      increase the surface energy of these materials so that we could bond them with epoxy. The idea is to <em> insert</em> a small piece of metal at the ends of the
      rod so that can be threaded and have bolt go through it. Now we solved how to put a carbon component to a metal frame.
    </p>

    <h3> Tensile Strength</h3>
    <p>
      In order to gauge the strength of the pushrod in tension, we ran a few tests. We first ran an FEA using the ACP tool in ANSYS Mechanical
      to get an estimate of what to expect. This is cheap and fast, however, composites are famously anisotropic and hard to characterize. 
      ANSYS can give you a <em>decent</em> prediction, but that won't suffice to persuade a team to integrate this idea.<br> Furthermore, adhesive bonds
      like epoxy are a whole science on their own by the physics of friction and whatnot. Even now, it's hard to describe friction, especially on a simulation
      software. <br>
      The next logical step is to run real-world validations. With the use of an Instron machine, we can see the failure points of our pushrod. Whether that be
      the adhesive bond, the cohesion of the epoxy, the pushrod snapping, or the insert galling. Each case would tell us something different and how to
      improve the design.
    </p>
    
    <h3> Compressive Strength </h3>
    <p>
      Like I said earlier, fiber laminates like carbon fiber are pretty bad in compression. But they will still hold up to some degree. In order to gauge
      how screwed we are, we ran several tests on a hyrdraulic press to see when it would fail. We expected to see the pushrod snap, buckle, or split like a log.
      This test is by far the most important as our <strong>push</strong>rod will be seeing a lot of compression. 
    </p>

    <h3> Insert Design </h3>
    <p>
      The design of the insert is also very important since it will be transmitting all the load through the bolt to the suspension. The basic idea of the insert
      is to act as a sleeve that goes inside the pushrod. The longer the sleeve is, the stronger the bond strength is by the epoxy. However, make it too long and 
      congratulations you have an aluminum pushrod. To optimize this, I calculated the length needed to sustain an arbitrary load given the lap shear 
      strength from the epoxy's data sheet and the inner diamater of the pushrod.<br>
      A method was also needed to inject epoxy in the gap without runoff or voids. My first idea was to just rub epoxy on the surface of the insert then
      stick it into the pushrod. We saw some other concepts where people drilled 2 small holes opposite of each other in the pushrod. However, I believe this
      greatly compromises the strength of the rod as the fibers are no longer continous. My method was to include two small holes through the top of the insert
      small channels to allow the epoxy to flow through. <br>
      There are other important factors like the flange thickness, material type, and the introduciton of a spacer at the bottom of the insert to try to prevent
      epoxy runoff and create concentricity. 
    </p>

    <h3>Adhesion and Cohesion</h3>
    <p>
      Last but not least, the bond between the carbon fiber surface and aluminum insert is one of the most critical parts. Ideally, we would see cohesive failure
      in the epoxy which is just a split midplane of the volume. This would mean we've optimized everything in our control to maximize the strength of the pushrod.
      The use of silica beads were an idea to implement to create an even good bond gap (concentric) and increase the shear strength of the epoxy. This was read about
      in research papers but a certain ratio has to be achieved otherwise it will weaken the cohesion. Finding this ration was also considered in this research.<br>
      Adhesion, like mentioned earlier, has to be achieved through special processes like physical abrasion to create more surface area or chemical abrasion to 
      increase the surface energy. Adhesion is something more authority over than cohesion, so we must do everything we can to maximize that bond.
