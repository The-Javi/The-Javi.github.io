    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project was my main contribution to the Solar Car in my freshman year. The goal was to design a simple lock to constrict our battery box.
      There were several criteria and constraints that had to be met:
      - Simple and manufacturable
      - Interface to kevlar-foam compostie sandwich
      - If underneath bottom panel, 1" clearance from floor
      - If on top of bottom panel, fit in a 3x3" area
      - Easy way to unlatch
      - Sustain a 5g impulse from 80kg battery box
    </p>

    <h2>Design & Process</h2>
    <p>
      I created an initial design in about 2 weeks, and met up with my lead to review it. The design was to complex with too many constraints and parts.
      It was ultimately junked and I started a new version. This time it was quicker to design since I knew what to avoid. I looked online for material prices,
      and pre-manufcatured parts like U-brackets and carbon-steel stock. The design was much smaller and easier to manufacture. 
      All the parts could be bought from a McMaster-Carr and were simple to machine.
