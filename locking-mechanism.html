    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project was my first contribution to the Solar Car, Daybreak, in my freshman year. 
      The goal was to design a simple lock to constrict our battery box.<br>
      There were several criteria and constraints that had to be met:
        <ul>
          <li>Simple and manufacturable</li>
          <li>Interface to kevlar-foam compostie sandwich</li>
          <li>If underneath bottom panel, 1" clearance from floor</li>
          <li>If on top of bottom panel, fit in a 3x3" area</li>
          <li> Easy method to unlatch</li> 
          <li>Sustain a 5g impulse from 80kg battery box</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Design & Process</h2>
    <p>
      I created an initial design in about 2 weeks, and met up with my lead (Cesar) to review it. The design was to complex with too many constraints and parts.
      It was ultimately junked and I started a new version. This time it was quicker to design since I knew what to avoid. I looked online for material prices,
      and pre-manufcatured parts like U-brackets and carbon-steel stock. The design was much smaller and easier to manufacture. All the parts could be bought 
      from McMaster-Carr and were simple to machine.

    <p>
      Before reviewing with Cesar, I created a proof-of-concept using 3D printers to show how simple it is to make.

      After reviewing with Cesar, a few adjustments were made to the base plate to optomize material volume and change location of bolting holes.

    <h2>Results & Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      This project was my first real project on the team. It did take a while to complete, but I'm glad I was able to design a component, get it reviewed,
      restart and pivot quickly, create a prototype, and finalize something that would be used to compete. At this point, I was getting more comfortable using
      SolidWorks and finding how much authority/freedom I had in the club.
