This project is was just a little fun thing I wanted on my desk to fidget with. A lot of learning on tolerancing with 3D printers came from this project. The print failed a couple of times, and the other times, my magnets and ball bearing did not fit. I finally came to finished piece after 2 weeks of design iterations and printing. Using SolidWorks to edit an existing model and find the center of mass so it can spin nicely was not too hard to do.

This little part has gone through 4 iterations of design and testing to find the best way to interface aluminum and carbon fiber using Loctite Epoxy. The biggest challenge here was finding the optimal design to have full epoxy coverage around the insert.

This was my first project implemented on the car for Longhorn Racing. There was a whole product redesign and honestly it was much needed. The old design was very clunky. This lock needed to be simple to manufacture and strong enough to withstand a crash. This was a very fun introduction to the engineering design process. I designed something, reviewed it with someone, restarted, reviewed again, ran simulations, built a prototype, and made a final product.
