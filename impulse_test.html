    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This was my final project for Electromechanical systems. My team designed and tested a method to gauge the effectivness of
      energy dissipation. In this lab, we investigated the force attenuation performance of three footwear types — Converse shoes, 
      walking sneakers, and basketball shoes — using controlled drop tests on a custom-calibrated force plate. By analyzing force–time
      responses and impulse across multiple impact energies, we aimed to determine how shoe design influences peak loading and energy 
      dissipation, and which configurations are most effective at reducing injury-relevant forces.

    <h2>Design & Process</h2>
    <p>
      Our final project gaves us the freedom to choose something to research using software and sensors we've used in class. We chose to
      utilize strain gauges as they are widely used in structural analysis.<br>
      Four gauges were arranged in a wheatestone bridge configuration to maximize the sensitivity of the sensors. <br>
      An aluminum plate was used for its ease of machining and rigidity for the scope of tests we performed.

    <h2>Results & Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Overall, the results demonstrate that carefully placed vortex generators can meaningfully
      reduce drag by delaying flow separation under certain conditions. However, their effectiveness is
      strongly dependent on Reynolds number, local flow conditions, and vehicle-specific geometries
